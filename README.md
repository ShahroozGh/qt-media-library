# qt-media-library
Song library + player, implemented in Qt 5.4.1

Song lists, Album Artwork and other resources are stored in a folder called songPro in your main Documents folder.
Currently the program requires this folder and its subfolders to exist before running.
See the Documents folder for example file structure.
